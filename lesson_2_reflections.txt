What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I think it stores meta data about files which is readable by git process.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Working directory contains all the files, but the staging area contains
only the once that are intended to be commited. It gives control of what
changes do we want to put in. This could be used for deploying to different
environments like testing/staging/prod or for different devices like mobile/
laptop/IOT depending upon confguration file. Each commits (on diff branches)
can then be used for compilation.
