What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I think it stores meta data about files which is readable by git process.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Working directory contains all the files, but the staging area contains
only the once that are intended to be commited. It gives control of what
changes do we want to put in. This could be used for deploying to different
environments like testing/staging/prod or for different devices like mobile/
laptop/IOT depending upon confguration file. Each commits (on diff branches)
can then be used for compilation.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Pulling in only the files related to the logical change into staging and then
commiting.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
For deploying to different environments like testing/staging/prod or for different devices
like mobile/laptop/IOT depending upon confguration file.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Very helpful.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it
in the diagram the way we do?
Its very very difficult to do the correct thing without this visualization.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Automatic merging is a good short cut for most scenarios, the responsibilities lies
with the developer.
